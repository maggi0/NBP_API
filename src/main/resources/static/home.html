        <h2>Currency</h2>
        <p>
          A currency is a standardization of money in any form, in use or circulation as a medium of exchange,
          for example banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money in common use
          within a specific environment over time, especially for people in a nation state. Under this definition,
          the British Pound Sterling (£), euros (€), Japanese yen (¥), and U.S. dollars (US$)) are examples of (government-issued)
          fiat currencies. Currencies may act as stores of value and be traded between nations in foreign exchange markets,
          which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are either chosen by users
          or decreed by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance - i.e. legal tender laws may require
          a particular unit of account for payments to government agencies.

        <h2>Exchange Rate</h2>
        <p>
          In finance, an exchange rate is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another currency.
          Currencies are most commonly national currencies, but may be sub-national as in the case of Hong Kong
          or supra-national as in the case of the euro.

          The exchange rate is also regarded as the value of one country's currency in relation to another currency.
          For example, an interbank exchange rate of 114 Japanese yen to the United States dollar means that ¥114 will be
          exchanged for US$1 or that US$1 will be exchanged for ¥114. In this case it is said that the price of a dollar
          in relation to yen is ¥114, or equivalently that the price of a yen in relation to dollars is $1/114.

        <h2>Gold</h2>
        <p>
          Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79. This makes it one of the
          higher atomic number elements that occur naturally. It is a bright, slightly orange-yellow, dense, soft, malleable,
          and ductile metal in a pure form. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least
          reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form,
          as nuggets or grains, in rocks, veins, and alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native
          element silver (as electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium, and mineral inclusions
          such as within pyrite. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).
